So, I've been working on creating a routine and adopting good habits to make sure I'm going towards where I want to be in life. I thought I should give Atomic Habits a listen - and that's what I did in the last week or so. It's a great book. I wrote about it in my previous post.

But what life has taught me in the days after finishing the book is that there are obstacles, huge and many, that can shatter habits. We can't always be privileged to stick to a routine; we are simply obstructed by many things.

When I was beginning on the journey of good habits and routine, I focused on the intrinsic nature of habits. And in that aspect, James Clear did a great job of clearly laying out how habits work. But habits and routines aren't everything. After a few days of sticking to the habits reasonably well, there were unavoidable obstacles. I was paralyzed and disappointed by these uncontrollable things.

Soon, I was able to label them as obstacles and then I recalled the book by Ryan Haliday - Obstacle is the Way. So naturally, I downloaded the audiobook and I'm listening to it now.

I revisited Ryan's YouTube channel, The Daily Stoic, to catch up on some Stoic content.

This is a new beginning for my Stoicism.

I heard Ryan saying "Routines are fragile" in some video. And then it hit me, yes! Routines are important, and they are fluid within the body of life, but without the spine holding the body up, it's fragile. So one has to learn how to deal with obstacles. Obstacles are the way indeed. It is only when you come to peace with obstacles, and treat them with the right perception and action, that habits and routines become relevant.

I sometimes keep thinking about others, about how their lives have fewer obstacles and thus it's easier for them to follow routines. But screw it. I'm learning so many good things about getting things my way, and I'm happy for it.

Thus, I am on the journey of treating routines and obstacles together and empowering myself whenever they happen.

But I have something to say about Ryan's book (on obstacles). It feels hollow. He speaks so much and sometimes presents contradictory ideas. It's not a coherent whole compared to James' book. Nevertheless, the topic itself is very useful to exist in this world where people are guided to skip obstacles and take shortcuts.
