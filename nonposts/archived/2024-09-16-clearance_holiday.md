When did all this began? Should I say it started when I skipped classes on thursday (and friday) or should I say it was when I went all rogue with science and gaming? So it started from Monday. Let me give you a glmipse of what was going through my mind this week.

**Monday**:
- Meeting with Dr. Yogesh.
    - More rage to continue reading Conformal Field Theory - OPEs...
    - A new perturbation towards digital note taking (perhaps I should say note TeXing).
**Tuesday**: 
- Ignition night ft. $\mathbb{C}^2, \delta (x)$.
    - I had only one class (after lunch) and I continued to read CFT in 2D for the day. The main friction this week were the calculations that seemed to pop up almost everyline. It has been an extremely non-linear expereince. But I managed to extract one calculation at a time, and in the night I manged to understand the representation of $\delta(x)$ that sort of lives on $\mathcal{C}^2$ but basically acts on $\mathcal{C}$ functions - more precisely - just the holomorphic (or anti-holomorphic) ones. It was a nice realization that made be curious about doing the o[ther calculations too.

**Wednesday** :
- Calculation of the day
    - I had only one class for the day again, which was on the first slot. After finishing with it (and other chores), I jumped to do some reading I think. I needed to workout the form of Ward Identities in terms of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices. I was a little confused about it in the beginning, but then I laid out the transformation in usual contravariant form, and used the tensor transformation laws, and explicitly explanded the terms to more or less get the same terms in each of the sub-expression giving a nice simplified answer that matches with Di Francesco's. This was a satisfying caclulaation and I rewarded myself with some FPS game-time :).
- Experience
    - After finising the class, I changed my t-shirt. I wanted to wear something comfy. I saw my torn grey full sleeved shirt. I cut the sleeves into half and wore it. It felt very _natural_ and _simple_. Just a cotton shirt with a plain color and a comfy size. I felt like a monk. I think what I mean is - I felt like a _practicer_. This is one of those finest feelings one can have :). I used my wall black-board for some time and then switched to sitting on floor. I used my thick blanket to cover the floor, and then I began reading the book/caluclating stuff. 
    - This is when I also lost track of time, missed my lunch, didn't take a bath until afternoon. I cooked tomato dal that day. Although the tanginess was low, the spicy flavors from hing, jeera, methi and mustard made it delish :). 
    - This is also the day when I was switching between gaming and calculating things on floor. I was doing insane things, yet my head was clear. I even meditated for few minutes in the evening. 
    - Well, then conformal ward identity came and prturbed me for a while.

**Thursday, Friday**:
- Another couple of days on floor
    - I couldn't imagine going to classes with the flow that I had in the last couple of days. I skipped the two classes I had for both the days. And once again, sat on the floor reading Francesco's CFT. Conformal Ward Identity occupied most of the time. But I think I was able to conclude that part and move ahead to OPEs for which I was very excited.
    - To conclude these two days - I managed to read through the Conformal Ward Identity, example calculations for OPE in free boson, fermion and ghost system (connected to some jacobian in string theoretic functional integral), formal theory on central charge including some physical meaning of it - and then the trace anomaly. I need to finalize many of these calculations - that's what my thesis diary is for :).
 - A note-TeXing perturbation
    - So my guide was talking about some perks of texing the notes insteaed of hand-writing. I really liked the idea because Iwas actually taking a lot of weekly notes [for which I am already quite happy :)] and the idea of digitizing them, being able to share them with Dr. Y and the world tempted me into figuring something out. 
    - So I spent a lot of time learning about vim and setting it up for latex in my wsl (ubuntu). The idea of keyboard only tex(t) editor is just awesome. Let's see how it goes. Also, I'm writing this very post on vim too :). I installed jekyll in wsl and will probably continue using this for all the git sutff too. Let's see where this takes me.
    - But after installing all the geeky stuff, when I actally sat down to write it - I realized these technologies still can't capture the depth of handwritten notes. I don't just take notes, but I take them with a flow of shapes, colors and ofcourse math. I am still very interested in digitizing them though. But I can't  compromise the artistic nature of notes. So until I figure out a reasonable way to capture the handwritten notes in a digital format I will continue diary-ing my thesis notes physically. 

**Saturday, Sunday**
- College fest vibes. Enjoyed dance, music and drama programmes of Saturday. It was a long day from 1400 to 2200. Before that I just did some vim related things - like setting up this blog things in wsl. 
- Wanted to play tennis on Sunday, but it rained and the court was wet. So we decided to play badminton instead. Aniket, Ganesh, and Sajag joined. Probably played a little too much for first day of badminton after long, but it was fun! 
- Rewatched Inside out (2015) after so long! Damn such a good movie. A great job at capturing different subtlties of mind! It was personally very connecting!  
**Monday (Today)**: 

After skipping classes for two days straight on Thurday and Friday, and after the flow that began on last monday, after a festive weekend, I  was definitely not ready to join the classes. I was feeling like shit since I woke up. I could barely wake up today. With help from someone, I managed to have my breakfast. I didn't take a bath yet. I reached library, and I am writing this blog from the conference table in the reference section. What began from asking around for turing on the air conditioning, ended up revealing that today is holiday! So I don't have to eat my head, and I have now time to process everything - from the thesis to classes. I can summarize all the calculations and theory I learned last week in my diary today and also caatch up with the missed lectures on Differential Equations and Astrophysics.


So, good day!
