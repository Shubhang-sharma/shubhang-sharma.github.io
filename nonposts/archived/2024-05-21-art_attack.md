Yesterday's [painting](/artreview/2024/05/20/peach_blue_clouds.html) of Abha left me feeling a lot of things. I really want to know how it feel like, when one paints, or sketches. The sheer action of putting something one imagines or sees onto a piece of paper is crazy. This paiting is making me feel things inside that I'm not able to express... I don't know how to deal with it. I should probably spend more time looking at it, so that I can reach an equilibrium. Or should I even aim to reach an equilibrium?  Why should the charms of the piece be finished? May be I will let things be how they are now. Ah askjfskdgjg. 

_The peach blue_ - by that I actually mean the peach and blue colors, but the whole painting is tempting me to name it _the peach blue (and then the clouds)._ The strokes, shapes, texture and colors are making me feel so much that I am distracted and not even imagining the story behind the painting, but yet it's still there in the background adding to the feelings...

I guess the same thing happens when I listen to music. I go into this zone of feeling the elements that music composed of, like vocal sounds, the instument sounds, the words... that I often forget that they have a meaning, meaning different may be different from what I feel but probably distant from what the artist expressed.

A duality of _strokes, colors, and the painting_ with that of _vocals, instrumentals, and the lyrics._ 

_The strange feeling of peach blue sky..._
