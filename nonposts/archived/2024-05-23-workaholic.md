A reference to AOT's Eren Jeager - _the suicide maniac._

I realized something. I don't take the usual paths, they are difficult for me. I lik to just work, work as much as possible and expect the outsomes. over the years, that's how I reaged over everything. I am a passion maniac who works based on passion instead of a well planned plan. Or maybe I never got an oppurtunity to do that. I never got an oppurtunity to plan amidst the chaos.  May be I was never privileged enough to do that given my interests. I kept going ahead, telling myself _fight_, _fight_, and _fight_... (natural dramatic effects post Shingeki No kyojin) And one day I will get the results that I want. May be that's a way too. Rather than a search for something, my passion guides me through. So may be it's not bad. I need to control my passion properly channel it to the right time scales and I might win through this fight.

Shinzo wo sasagayo!

That's what I have been doing for a long time now. I enjoy doing that, and more importantly that has become my natural way of doing things... Doing things out of passion.

Lately I have been doing that even more. I raged over the Gauge Theory book, I raged over the website making.

And it's not like I am a complete blinf maniac too. I am not blind, I barge in but I'm not blind. I do lay out the necessary plan. So yeah, I am going to continue this, use my passion to my advantage and stop doubting myself. 

 This dictates how I see appraoch the positions in academia. I see it completely through the hearts of a passionate fella. By passionate I don't just mean curiosity. It's topped with something else too. Let me elaborate.

<!-- First, I see Abha searching a lot about basic of PhD and research and community and everything. I always thought my passion will take me to the right places. 

I think Abha and I differ in a key aspect. I look for stories in academia that fit for me. I tend to re inforce what I opine. While Abha also does that, she constantly looks for stories that tend to build her. She makes herself out of them, and that's why she reached at her thought _you hunt for stories searching for a home, only to realize you must writie your own._ 

But back to being a baka, I like to still put my future in the hands of passion. A more aware passion. If it's driving me forwards then why not. ANd it had driven people since ages, and lead to beautiful things. So nothing's wrong in this. 


So that said, let me elaborate on how I see myself in academia. I am gonna simply trust my work and apply that's it. Not gonna do things just for my application. Not gonna change my work for that... I will let my passion speak for me, the work speak for me.

And I'm gonna take web development seriously. Up those skills to have a passive income. So an year from now, I am aiming to complete a legit project, atleast two legit math courses through which I can get recommendations. And be able to make artistic and responsive sites. And finally a strong body too. Oh, and yes, talks, decent number of them; to show that I understand stuff and am confident about it.
