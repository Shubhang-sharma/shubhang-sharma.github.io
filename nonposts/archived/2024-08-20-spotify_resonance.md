Occasionally when it's your day - there's a moment of resonance with spotify. After an episode of sadness and disappointment and then a low-key rage to get back being good by listening to songs - the spotify shuffle does its magic - every song it plays adds to that low-key rage, as if it's pushing me towards healing. It feels nice to be driven automatically to a better state :).
