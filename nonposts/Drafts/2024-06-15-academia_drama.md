Through conversations with Abha about Academia after recent rejection of Master's thesis on the interesection of differential geometry and Physics, I gained a deeper perspective on Academia. 

Honestly, it's a slap in the face to the _a Passion Maniac_ post. It's good! I feel understood and then drenched. It's satisfying. 

(I am writing this on 21st of June. Yeah that's how many days my mind took to settle down and write about this.)
