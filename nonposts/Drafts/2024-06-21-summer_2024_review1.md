From deeper thoughts on academia, to learning about habit building, to sticking to a strength and conditioning plan, to learn about diet and nutirtion to the many fricking obstacles... the first half of the summer break was reasonably intensne. I just finished writing about obstacles in my diary. I will soon put things in perspective in this blog. (That will take time yeah, I am already tired for this sesssion of updating the page.)
