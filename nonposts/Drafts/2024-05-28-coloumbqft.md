Having heard through many talks, books and notes that QFT aims to explain particle interactions at the very fundamental level, I waited eagerly to learn how QFT _derives_ the coloumb potential viz. the non-relativistic interaction between two charged particles. If you haven't yet, it's truly worth watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNVQfWC_evg&t=39s&pp=ygUZcXVhbnR1bSBmaWVsZHMgZGF2aWQgdG9uZw%3D%3D) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo&t=48s&pp=ygUfZGF2aWQgdG9uZyBxdWFudHVtIGZpZWxkIHRoZW9yeQ%3D%3D). 

The goal of this article is to make the _derivation_ of coloumb potential accessible to the curious minds and to pass the feels of Quantum Field theory by reproducing an infamous result! Hopefully I will also give a talk on this next semester.

__Disclaimer__: The statements won't be (mathematically) precise.

## 1. The notion of _fields_

We ditch the relativistic particle Quantum Mechanics and move to fields. This is a story of its own and hopefully there will be a blog coming soon on the beginnings of QFT. Here we state the tools, feel them and move on.


### 1.1 Understanding Fields in n-levels  

- Fields are functions of space and time - $\phi(x,t)$
- These are the dynamical variables of our new theory. They have infinite degrees of freedom.
- Physically we are interested in the representations of Poincar√© group on the space of fields. This will be cleared in the next section.
