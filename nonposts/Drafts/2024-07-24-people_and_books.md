I feel a distance from the issues of the modern world. I feel to do something about the issues. Issues of both opoersonal and societal, environmental and socio-econommical, academic and industry. Given these all, I mostly feel a need to get in touch with the voices of people already invested in these directions. I am finding new book every other day that make me believe that there are people  who want to do good and honest work towards their values. I want to know them, their works, through their writing or talks. I want to indulge in reading them.

I am excited about the book _The art of self-theraapy_. And I am currently reading _i want to die but i want to eat tteokbokki_. It's a great book having internal dialogue of an individual doing therapy and also their converstaions with a psychiatrist. It's a delightful read, knowing humanity's thoughts and journeys is something that is dear to me. 

Also, reading didn't become a part of my life beacuse of lack of exposure to it in the cildhood, but now I can start slowly. It's alright I think. 

I just feel good that there are people out their whose works I really admire. 

Some of the things I am excited about right now are

- Scroll.in
- Hindustani Musalman
- Harsh Mander
- Indian History: Political and Religional
- Eco India: A scroll.in thing, that I have been kinda following since my high school! It's great!
- Many more books I found at airport...
- Hindustani Musalman
