So I'm listening the audiobook 'Atomic Habbits'. I heard this book from Ali Abdal before I joined college, but never gave it a read. I am not a person who works on myself unless I know that it is important to, unless I really appreciate it. So, these days while I am trying to cooking, studying and exercise routine; I thought it would be great to here out what other people have to say about this while I learn from my experiences too. 

I think the mindset that helps me the most is - I am not looking for how to do it, Im looking for what _you think_ works, what _your experiences_ taught you. When you look books from that perspective, it is really helpful. All you gotta do is take a backseat perspective relate it to yourself, do your own thing with your mind, and work on yourself! I guess that was the whole point of books anyway. People try to write because they want to share their experiences, but again as usual like any other thing in the modern world, things tend to get distorted from their true meanings, and it is easy to get stumbled upon many perspectives to reach the crux.

And the audio is such a gamechanger, I can listen to it while I cook! And I enjoy so much listening people talk about their experiences - it gives me joy hearing humanity talk passionately about their stories, especially in a way that resonates with me. And yes -  James clear writes them in a frequency that resonates with me so much. The way of writing about thoughts, the way of thinking.... 

[I am writing this from the future - really, the way of writing the thoughts and thinking about them matters so much to me. I am trying to listen to Dr. Frederica Amati's _Everybody should know this_ on the science of eating and nutrition. But I don't find the experience quite resonating. I am still gonna continue listening though, before I leave it. May be I will get closer to her frequency if I do continue, let's see.]

Yeah, reading is a crucial game! You see, I take this approach of living by my own, and learning from my experiences, but I have to, to some degree learn from others. Actually I am interested, I just need an easy way to do it? Like audiobook? May be.  

Fiction books do not hit me because of the _tangent space_ analogy. But that's for another time. Ofcourse a lot of this has to do with childhood training, but yeah... that's for another time.

 But maybe currenty, I can't afford my time reading a book? Yeah, more than reading a book or listening to an audio, I value _my own_ experiences and learnings, because they come directly from inside my mind and they speak for me. And I am reasonably self-aware and introspective. But I would have my own biases and shortcomings ... And thus I managed to only give time to my own thinking. But once in a while I do seek help from the books. This time, I am glad I started the audiobook! It gives me space to do my own thing, while managing to let a book sneak in through my ears.
