Dad and I travelled to Sringeri Math and Udupi math last week. More than 5 years ago, my parents had planned to get my Upanayana done in Sringeri Math but ended up doing it at the Mantralayam Math. But they prayed that I shall seek darshan from the Sringeri peethadipathi after the Upanayana. So that was the motivation for the trip. And we covered beautiful places surrounding these places - beaches and a waterfall. I had quite a nice time thinking about various aspects of Hindu Philosophy, Science and Nature. While I share my thoughts which arose during the trip it’s good to cover some history of Hindu/Indian Philosophy on the go.

I was waiting in the Guru Nivas inside the monastery for the puja to begin and to seek darshan of the Shankaracharya after that. Having no clue about what I am here for and what the whole place is about, I started surfing through the net about the Sringeri math. The place is believed to be established by (the) Adi (first) Shankaracharya (8th c. CE) who was a great Hindu philosopher keen to spread Advaita Vedanta - one of the many school of thoughts of Hinduism. I thus learned that Hindu Philosophy has many school of thoughts. I was quite delighted to know that this was all about philosophers trying to understand and practice many aspects of life in peace on the banks of a river (Tungi). Sringeri is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya. The acharya tradition of these mathas is being continued since a long time, and the current acharya is the 36th on the tradition line. They have a beautiful tree covering, with HUGE trees. There is also a gurukul - training students in Vedas and the Hindu Philosophy, an Advaita research center, and apparently a library with a large collection of Hindu scriptures, and manuscripts, including the palm leaves ones! I want to take a look at the whole monastery more closely next time, and visit the library too.

But I simply cannot believe in seeking darshan and blessings of the Shankaracharya. The whole time when I was waiting in the queue, I was fascinated and frustrated by how people are worshiping philosophers! I personally have a very deep respect to philosophy and the people who study it, in fact the very act of me studying science is just this - scientific philosophy - and looking to do a Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD). But praying them? Seeking blessings? Come on!

A scientific analogue (not replacement) to such acts could be, I would say - talk. If you need some scientific explanation, talk to a scientist. That includes talking to a therapist when we are struggling with something psychological! In general I think there is a need to spread science to masses. To spread thinking on the lines of science rather than some unnatural force bracing them. I was I want to spread science as a religion like Adi Shankaracharya did with a specific school of Hindu religion.

The place was absolutely inspiring. The fresh air that I got to breath was something I never got to do in a LONG time. Rarely did I have such a calm feeling in my lungs and the whole body.

All this motivated me to think about establishing School of Science functioning like a monastery - funded from donations, services, science museums (like darshans), farming e.t.c situated in a place free from pollution, constructed and functioning sustainably!

le we were continueing to travel to other places, I had thoughts on absorbing the best of this matha culture and I was able to relate to them. I mean I was able to understand the importance of them. I was thinking about scientific institutions in the framework of these Mathas.

I was also thinking about atheism and Hinduism. That’s when I learned that, there is an atheistic school of thought in Hinduism! In fact, Hinduism is an exonym! To quote Amarthya Sen (directly taken from Wikipedia),

> In some ways people had got used to the idea that India was spiritual and religion-oriented. That gave a leg up to the religious interpretation of India, despite the fact that Sanskrit had a larger atheistic literature than what exists in any other classical language. Madhava Acharya, the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called Sarva Darsana Samgraha, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Indian structure. The first chapter is "Atheism" – a very strong presentation of the argument in favor of atheism and materialism.

Why don’t we do it. Why don’t we build a science monasteries. The pursuit of science is a very meditative act, and a distraction free environment living close to the true values of individuals and a community rather than marketed things is needed! We need passionate architects, mathematicians, physicists, engineers, psychologists, and many others to coordinate such a place.

I was imagining of a science museums with an entry ticket price - and provide a good experience of science to the public. Gravity, Mechanics, Quantum mechanics, Particle Physics, Statistical Physics, Thermodynamics, Mathematics - many of these things can be made into artistic installations and bring the museums and art galleries together.

One can start with Physics (Theoretical) and Mathematics center first, requiring relatively very low funds!

The idea is to start from a basic functioning institute with a room to teach, a room to sleep/rest, cook, and a washroom. Then build the place with the students and the members involved, probably even through volunteers who are not necessarily enrolled in the scientific curriculum of the monastery. The place needs to run self-sustainably, and sustainably open to all activities - books, cycling, trekking, music, theatre club, cleaning premises, carpentry, gardening … and many more! Place has to be a little remote and calm. I don’t know where… but the plantation has to begin very early… The area has to be covered with trees!

This blog barely scratches this dream of science monasteries. I am motivated to build this. I will continue to blog about this in future. I am eager to study the practical things associated with this. So scholars, architects, engineers, gardeners, farmers, any one who think they might be relevant for this project contact me with your thoughts on this, including any book/information suggestions! We need passionate people to plan this out.

CheerS.
