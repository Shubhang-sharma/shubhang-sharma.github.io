... and also mornings... the actual title I wanted to give was Mornings are awesome too!

Lately, I have been going through some hopelessness about the future, which is messing with my head. I started to take long walks in the evenings and at night. Eventually, nights were the time when things were calmer, away from all the expectations to work and function well during the day. I would finally pull myself together to go for a walk to get a breather - a change of mood. So I think, for over a month now, my body has learned to function well in the evenings, in the dark. Amidst my daytime hopelessness and static, I looked forward to that sunset, after which I could finally start working.

Interestingly, summer had already begun here. I think it might be visceral, too. The temperature of the evenings might have provided a safe space for my nerves to calm down.

I have started to notice this pattern for a couple of days. Especially today, I realised how excited I am to go for a walk in the evening! But you know what, today I also wanted to walk in the morning, or just be outside. Actually, I wanted to work outside. But sadly, Jatni temperatures and NISER’s architecture kick those needs right across the scene :/. Trust me, I tried to work almost everywhere on campus. Amphitheatre, Meditation centre, Cricket Ground, LH complex, Flag post garden, near animal centre…

So yeah, just when I wanted to go out and feel the day, I got reminded of the Indian weather. But damn, I used to hate evenings and nights honestly. I guess I did that during non-summer months. Because I love sunlight, and I always wish it to last longer. But a combination of mental and visceral made me appreciate the calmness of nights! I think I can finally enjoy all the parts of the day now!

Today I woke up early to be able to finish my take-home exam in time. I need to relive the early mornings - something is definitely cooking ; ) . This reminds me of my Dad’s habit of waking up early in the morning whenever he is outside travelling. He actually freaking wakes up at 4 am these days but anyway….

Anecdote time:

Last winter, Dad and I travelled to Udupi and places around. We woke up early in the morning to visit the Sringeri Math during all its peaceful hours. I think that’s when we philosophised that, early mornings are the perfect time to enjoy a place, before it’s all dominated (or polluted in cynical words, or sentient in flaneur words ;) ) by the presence of humans for the rest of the day!
