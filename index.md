        <h2>$\hookrightarrow$ ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p class="about-p">
        I have recently finished my coursework in Integrated Masters in Physical Science from National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India. I did my master's thesis on AdS/CFT correspondence and it's  connection to geometry of manifolds. I am interested in topics at the interface of Mathematics and Physics. Broadly, I am inclined towards Geometry and Topology on the math side and towards Quantum Field Theory and GR on the physics side. See my article on <em>The story of Mathematical Physics</em> in the bundle page for a sweeping account of interaction between the two sciences along with multiple viewpoints of mathematical physics as a field. Some  important directions include symplectic geometry and classical mechanics, gauge theory, and more.</p>

      <h2>$\hookrightarrow$ What am I doing now?</h2>
      <p>A general answer to this question has to wait. But zooming in to day-to-day life; academically, I am working through Terry Tao's Analysis 1 and TeXing lecture notes on Manifolds. I am  also planning to work on a SoME submission this time finally. It will be an article and a website designed based on deRahm's theoery and Electromagnetism, mostly inspired by John  Baez's <em>Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity.</em> I have realized my understanding of social structure is on the weaker side, so I initiated a process to get scholarly around it. I am reading <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari and listening to the great lectures by Dr. Vinay Lal on History and Culture Contemporary India  these days. The lectures on History of Indian Civilization are also quiet rigorous! Currently, I am also looking for place to stay for the next year where there is some resonance in academic and personal values.</p>
      <p>That was an answer zoomed over the space. Zooming <em>out</em> in time a little, there are some interesting things I have been upto. For some time now, I have been enjoying the Indian classical music very much. I  have been listening to Hindusthani music since almost two years now, but few months back I started to appreciate carnatic music too! I am finally able to experience the beauty of vocals in classical music. Towards the end of the last year (2024), I have started indulging in psychology related reading for many reasons, the most basic being - well liking psychology. Books like the art of self therapy, I want to die but I want to eat tteokbokki, lost connections, feeling seen, platonic, and the body keeps the score - are occupying my mind since some time now. The most basic shift in perspective I had durng this journey was how the current workd is disconnected in the most fundamental ways and how marketing industry is absolutely winning over humanity. While on a more positive note, I have started to  enjoy more minimalist</p>
      <p>Current guiding principle: <em>To become a scholar... To humanize teaching (and science) and reward deep thought... </em></p>
