        <p>Dad and I travelled to Sringeri Math and Udupi math last week. More than 5 years ago, my parents had planned to get my Upanayana done in Sringeri Math but ended up doing it at the Mantralayam Math. But they prayed that I shall seek darshan from the Sringeri peethadipathi after the Upanayana. So that was the motivation for the trip. And we covered beautiful places surrounding these places - beaches and a waterfall. I had quite a nice time thinking about various aspects of Hindu Philosophy, Science and Nature. While I share my thoughts which arose during the trip it’s good to cover some history of Hindu/Indian Philosophy on the go.</p>

        <p>It was the last week of the seemingly low-key month of an year, September. But behold the beautiful sunshine! I had just watched a brilliant video on our indulgence in compulsions (imposed mainly by the marketing industry backed by the current notions of economic development) rather than what we really want to do. It was also during this time, that I had resumed playing Valorant after almost 3 years and also started watching a new web series on Netflix.</p>

        <p>So I’m listening the audiobook ‘Atomic Habbits’. I heard this book from Ali Abdal before I joined college, but never gave it a read. I am not a person who works on myself unless I know that it is important to, unless I really appreciate it. So, these days while I am trying to cooking, studying and exercise routine; I thought it would be great to here out what other people have to say about this while I learn from my experiences too.</p>

        <p>Yesterday’s <a href="/artreview/2024/05/20/peach_blue_clouds.html">painting</a> of Abha left me feeling a lot of things. I really want to know how it feel like, when one paints, or sketches. The sheer action of putting something one imagines or sees onto a piece of paper is crazy. This paiting is making me feel things inside that I’m not able to express… I don’t know how to deal with it. I should probably spend more time looking at it, so that I can reach an equilibrium. Or should I even aim to reach an equilibrium?  Why should the charms of the piece be finished? May be I will let things be how they are now. Ah askjfskdgjg.</p>
