    <div class="bg"><p>So, I am stressed about the meeting with my Thesis supervisor. I was not able to work on my thesis properly in the last week. Although I did work a little. Most of my stress comes from the fact that I tend to have ambitious goals of understanding viz. a huge list of fundamental topics to understand first before going furhter. The next topic I need to learn about is how fields behave under Conformal Transformations. Looking at the chapter 4 of Francesco’s Conformal Field Theory book, I realized I need to study the symmetries subchapter of chapter 2 too. And I was not able to read it since I felt like I was under a time crunch.</p>

<p>I need to work more consistently. Last week was not good.</p>

<p>I am also tending to overly list out things that I am supposed to do, rather than actually reading them. I think it’s because I am expecting myself to work more, even when I don’t properly have an headspace - I tend to see such planning as working too. But unfortunately that isn’t reading. And I need to spend more time reading than planning what to read. For that I need to take proper breaks and heal myself from temporary troubles. I need to resume meditation.</p>
