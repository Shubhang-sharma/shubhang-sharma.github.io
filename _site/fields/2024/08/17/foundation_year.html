    <div class="bg"><p>At the beginning of my second year in college just after chosing to major in Physics, I used to wonder - <em>how could one possibly learn all the fundamental physics developed in the last couple of centuries?</em> Well, as it turns out, it isn’t. You can only accept some of it and move on.</p>

<p>So, my very imperfect four years of college took me here.</p>

<blockquote>
I don't want to pursue doctoral studies after my Master's; for there's so much physics and art to feel and explore...
</blockquote>

<p>I am interested in a career path in academia, but only if these values are appreciated. I want to be slow in sciences. I don’t want to rush it in. So, I’m gonna give myself an year to explore, try learning things the way I want to, and also try some art viz. web and game development. And I will see where this will take me, I might learn the subjects well enough that I apply for a PhD after that or I might find peace in the sci-art. I want to do a PhD with an exploration in art done, not to be done. It just feels right to pause for an year and wonder about things. It is true that I don’t see myself qualified enough to apply for PhDs from the viewpoint of typical applications. But it is more importantly true that I don’t want to be ready either - this is not how I want to enter into a PhD programme, so why fret over chasing some path that I don’t believe in?</p>

<p>I would love a simple life, so I don’t mind if I must be a little frugal during the break year.</p>

<p>As to the reasons which lead to this decisions - where do I begin?</p>

<p>It defnitely began when I had been denied an opportunity to work in the area of my interest. The past hustle finally showed up. It was not worth it. Chasing a straight default path hoping that one day you would be seen with all your values is a hurtful process. It’s better to be more honest with yourself and say - “I know I want this with certain values - so I will do it, slowly - may be even take some alternatives, but let me go ahead my way and try out things”. So clearly all the slow hustle of four years, made me realize that - hoop jumping is not for me, and the goal path can thus be not compared with that of folks who are more at ease with hoop jumping. So, I have shifted my focus onto a path, which might not exist yet - a pathless path, a creative path. I don’t have to do what everyone else is doing.</p>

<p>Although it seems like I am learning this anew, these thoughts seem to have been existed already in my teenage mind. I used to think, ‘science has to be done slow to be able to actually appreciate it’. So, I think I care about science in a different way - I think I want to pursue science like an artist - for science is indeed an art.</p>

<p>It is also true that, I have the privilege of not worrying to earn for my family - My parents have worked hard to earn a good living. I take this privilege of mine to be my ultimate gift from them. The previlege to find happiness and meaning amidst modern turmoil of <em>work</em>. I have not seen the world, I have been too busy sticking to a path and carving things but aiming for the path that’s not made for me - so here I am steering to a different path - but this time, I will keep my chin up and see what the world is about.</p>

<p>My parents are really supportive about this decision - they just want to me earn a good living and live happily. They trust me and also encourage me to take different paths. I might take some unconventional ones, I hope they don’t mind.</p>

<p>My rough plan for the next 2 years -</p>

<p>Mainly I want to explore some artistic media that I had in my mind since a long time. I want to pursue them along with the basic math and physics with a better headspace.</p>

<p>But I also want to live independently after finishing the Master’s. So, let’s talk about the finance situation - 
Initially I was quite concerned about this. I was trying to figure out ways to earn money by myself to be able to afford a simple living to fund the foundation year. I was trying to see the exploration directions in money making directions too. But my mom said something brilliant, she said - “but if you do that, you will be shifted to money mind, you will not able able to focus properly on the things that you want to do”. Only after that I realized how, indeed my mind was mixing up things and making it weird. But when I accepted that my parents can support me for a little longer, I was able to see more clearly the things that I want to do.</p>

<p>So, I will really take that year as an exploration year and go ahead. And now what about the final year of my masters?</p>

<p>My plan is to learn main Web development skill and 3D design to some extent before the academic year ends. So that I will be able to explore the art in a more seamless way. As of now, I am learning HTML, CSS from freeCodeCamp and blender from Belder Guru.</p>

<p>I think I can learn reasonable amount of it in an year. I am trying to be consistent with it by working on web development atleast 15 minutes a day. This was inspired by the author of <em>Think Big</em> talking about working on ME+ consistently - 13 minutes a day - adding to around 90 minutes per week. It does make a difference in the end!</p>

<p>I am also trying to not see my acads as my whole lifestyle, by including other routines too mainly the artistic ones.</p>

<p>I know web, 3D design can be very technical but I believe I can keep my artistic perspective intact. I have been doing that since many years now, so I guess it will be alright!</p>
