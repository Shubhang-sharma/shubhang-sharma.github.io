    <div class="bg"><p>Yesterday’s <a href="/artreview/2024/05/20/peach_blue_clouds.html">painting</a> of Abha left me feeling a lot of things. I really want to know how it feel like, when one paints, or sketches. The sheer action of putting something one imagines or sees onto a piece of paper is crazy. This paiting is making me feel things inside that I’m not able to express… I don’t know how to deal with it. I should probably spend more time looking at it, so that I can reach an equilibrium. Or should I even aim to reach an equilibrium?  Why should the charms of the piece be finished? May be I will let things be how they are now. Ah askjfskdgjg.</p>

<p><em>The peach blue</em> - by that I actually mean the peach and blue colors, but the whole painting is tempting me to name it <em>the peach blue (and then the clouds).</em> The strokes, shapes, texture and colors are making me feel so much that I am distracted and not even imagining the story behind the painting, but yet it’s still there in the background adding to the feelings…</p>

<p>I guess the same thing happens when I listen to music. I go into this zone of feeling the elements that music composed of, like vocal sounds, the instument sounds, the words… that I often forget that they have a meaning, meaning different may be different from what I feel but probably distant from what the artist expressed.</p>

<p>A duality of <em>strokes, colors, and the painting</em> with that of <em>vocals, instrumentals, and the lyrics.</em></p>

<p><em>The strange feeling of peach blue sky…</em></p>
