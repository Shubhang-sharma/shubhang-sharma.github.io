    <div class="bg"><p>An eternal process of finding that you might have to read more things to read the current thing. This runs recursively and densely :/. I think I need to communicate with my advisor as to properly decide the direction I need to take. I will draw some of thisw stuff on obsidian canvas, but the main medicine to this is the clarity of which direction to pursue and which to not. I need to talk to my guide, instead of hoping for more time (eternally).</p>

<p>I need to decide whether I should learn about Path Integrals first or continue conformal things - but the later one often involves a lot of path-integral stuff and some identities relating to that.</p>
