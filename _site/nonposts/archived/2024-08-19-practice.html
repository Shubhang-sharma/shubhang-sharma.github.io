    <div class="bg"><p>I clearly am facing the consequences of a mind out of practice, a mind out of mindfulness, a mind succumbded to the worldly stress. I could see myself coming out of the practicing mind, but I neglected it. I now see clearly the consequences.</p>

<p>I will now commit to the idea of practicising the philosphies of life constantly. We must sharpen them regularly. For me meditation, and journaling are such an act of practice.</p>

<p>I will journal more regularly and meditate regularly from now on. I have been doing it, but since 10 days, I have crashed. It was easy to miss more days after missing a couple. And it’s also because I was not headstrong about my weekend plans.</p>

<p>I wonder - does discipline take a headstrong mindset about things? What if I don’t have it? I mean life hits you, and it feels like you need a more figured out mind to be able to stick to your routines or plans. But, I guess I need to just “commit” to things, just like I have been commiting to duolingo and web dev.</p>

<p>The recent crash has been due to a discontent with the amount of work or a missing milestone in my web dev/3D learning. I got impatient and I worked in random hours, destroying the entire plan of things.</p>

<p>I will now commit to working between 0900 and 1730 hours and meditate/journal/play between 1730 and 1900 hours and work on the side projects - the artistic ones for the rest of the period. More importantly I have to work harder to sieze the day’s time to be able to work on those avenues. I need to wake up early and work on them, so that I can feel the constant <em>light</em> of them.</p>

<p>But again, it should also be simple, beacause consistency is the key, not just the hardwork.</p>

<p>Mondays are going to be demanding, because of the project meeting and assignment. But yeah, I need to rest well and begin the next day without a lot of baggage!</p>
