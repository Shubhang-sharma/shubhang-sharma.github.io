	We meditate to remind ourselves that, like the blue sky, our enlightened nature is always with us. Even when it's obscured by clouds.

<p>I don’t understand why, but I feel repelled by the idea of going deep into the calculations and work them out myself. Is it the trauma from the past, when I used to do it so much - leaving me traumatized? Or is it the constant ticking of time that is preventing me to explore the calculations fully? I am interested in doing those calculations though, but I am just not able to put myself through it.</p>

<p>While writing the previous sentence, I felt a little relieved. I am starting to see this as a phase - may be it will pass soon. Until then, I think I should be kind to myself and accept this repulsion.</p>

<p>I think I am just not able to let go of the repulsive negative thoughts. I am trying to block them - I need to instead let them come and then let them go <em>gently</em>. Again, I need to resume meditation. I need more headspace.</p>

<p>And oh, I think I also need better nutrition. I haven’t been eating that great lately. I will see to it :).</p>
