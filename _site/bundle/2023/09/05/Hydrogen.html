    <h2>Retarded Hydrogen Atom</h2>
    The non-relativistic Hydrogen atom has the following spectrum,

      <figcaption class="small center"></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>High resolution spectrometers observed a fine splitting of the above degeneracy. What follows below is a more
      detailed analysis of the Hydrogen atom Hamiltonian to explain the fine structure.</p>


    <h2>Baby Dirac equation</h2>


    <p>How do we reconcile the interaction of electron in a hydrogen atom with the magnetic field? Here's how people
      have tried formulating. </p>

    <p>For a loop carrying a current I, we write the magnetic moment $\bar{\mu} = \frac{I \bar{A}}{C}$. So, an electron
      with orbital
      angular momentum $\bar{L}$ has $\bar{\mu} = \frac{q}{2mC}\bar{L}$.</p>

    <p>Being reasonably intuitive, people have tried writing $\bar{\mu} = g \frac{e}{2m_eC} \bar{S}$ for the magnetic
      moment due to the
      quantum spin of electron. Clearly we were ambitious about the nature of magnetic moment in quantum regime in
      writing it almost
      same as classical one. But we have also parametrized all our ignorance in the factor $g$. Experiments show that $g
      \approx 2$, a simple <i>2</i> for the electron! So
      quantum spin is not that strange from classical after all! But nevertheless this is the first glance at why the
      quantum spin is not about
      electron spinning around it's axis, although telling us its probably okay to think on those lines (with a
      whispering $g$ accompanying every time). </p>

    <p>So, Pauli in 1927 went on to formulate this whole business. He noticed something funny, that

      \begin{align}
      (\bar{\sigma} .\bar{a}) (\bar{\sigma} .\bar{b}) = (\bar{a}.\bar{b} +i\bar{\sigma}.
      (\bar{a}\times\bar{b})) \tag{1}
      \end{align}

      gives $(\bar{\sigma} .\bar{p})^2 = \bar{p}^2$.
      With prior learning from Stern-Gerlach eperiment regarding the two spin states of electron, he started out with
      writing the Hamiltonian eigenstate as a column vector, a 2-spinor; $\psi = \begin{bmatrix} \chi \\
      \eta \end{bmatrix}$.</p>


    <p>Rewriting the hamiltonian this way replacing $\bar{p}^2$ with $(\bar{\sigma}.\bar{p})^2$ and in present of the
      E.M fields, $\bar{p} \rightarrow \bar{\pi} = \bar{p} - \frac{q}{C}\bar{A}$,
      we have

      \begin{align}
      H_{Pauli} &amp;= {\frac {1}{2m}}\left[{\bar {\sigma }}\cdot (\bar {p} -q\bar {A} )\right]^{2}+q\phi \tag{2} \\
      &amp;= \frac{1}{2m}\left(\bar {p} -q\bar {A} \right)^{2}-2\times\frac{q\hbar {\bar {\sigma }}\cdot \bar {B}}{2m}+q\phi
      \\
      &amp;= {\frac {1}{2m}}\left[|\bar {p} |^{2}-q(\bar {L} +2\bar {S} )\cdot \bar {B}
      \right]+q\phi \tag{3}

      \end{align}

      Where we have assumed magnetic field is weak in writing the third line. The g-factor is naturally
      seen to be 2 in the Pauli equation as the coefficient of $\bar{S}$.
    </p>

    <h2>The Dirac equation</h2>
    The Electromagnetic interaction is reconciled due to Pauli, and even the Lande's g-factor for the electron is
    explained! In 1928 Dirac figured a way to blend the relativistic artifacts correctly with the Pauli's equation.
    This is a nice point to discuss the issues in relativistic formulation that physicists faced which ultimately lead
    to QFT. I divert all such subtleties to a blog titled <i><a href="">The beginnings of QFT</a></i>, but for now I
    will assume Dirac
    equation is a nice way to reconcile the relativistic mechanics in the quantum world.
    To escape the infinite orders of terms when one expands the relativistic energy, Dirac wrote $p^2C^2 + m^2C^4$ as a
    square of some linear function of $p$. Clearly there are no mixing terms, so Dirac went crazy. He wrote,
    $$p^2C^2 + m^2C^4 = (C\bar{\alpha}.\bar{p} + \beta mC^2)$$
    Doing the obvious sanity checks leaves us with $(\alpha_i)^2 = \beta^2 = 1; \alpha_i\beta + \beta\alpha_i = 0 =
    \alpha_i\alpha_j + \alpha_j\alpha_i$. With nice <a href=""><i>little discussion</i></a> on when will such properties
    be satisfied,
    one ends up with the following representation,
    \begin{align}
    \bar{\alpha} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \bar{\sigma} \\
    \bar{\sigma} &amp; 0
    \end{bmatrix}; \beta = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbb{1} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -\mathbb{1}\end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}

    <h2>Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation</h2>
    I understand only the following as of now:
    <p>Writing $\psi = \Omega^{-1}\chi$ with $\Omega = 1 + \frac{(\bar{\sigma}.\bar{\pi})^2}{8m^2C^2}$ gives the right
      Fine structure Hamiltonian.</p>



    <h2>The Fine structure of Hydrogen atom</h2>
    Cut to post Barton Zwiebach lecture binge. Here's the Hydrogen Atom Fine structure summarized.

    <h2>Zeeman Structure</h2>

    <p>In explaining the Fine strcture of Hydrogen atom, we used the Dirac equation and added an electromagnetic
      interaction term, eventually assuming only the internal coloumbic electric field to be present i.e. no other
      external electric or magnetic field. In this section we will introduce an external magnetic field.</p>

      <p>The strategy is as follows - Start with the good old not so fine Hamiltonian and
