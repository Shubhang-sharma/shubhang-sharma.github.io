    <div class="bg"><p>Okay, so I did classical differential geometry this semester. And it was not so rigorous. It was not that
    abstract either. This is a post to put things in
    perspective. I want to pick out the abstract essentials of the course, so that it doesn't go into waste and I don't
    regret not learning a reasonably famous and interesting subject.</p>

<h2>Why did I do the course?</h2>
<p>After doing a course on Rings and Modules, I was afraid of algebra. Mostly because it has been clearly proved
    that with courses in SPS going full fledged I cannot do justice to the beautiful abstraction of math. Since
    I had courses like General
    Theory of relativtiy and Quantum Field theory II which would be intensive, I thought I shouldn't challenge
    myself. I thought I should take a course like Complex Analysis or Differential Equations, something that I
    know can be less abstract than algebra yet rigorous. Don't get me wrong, I love abstraction, it's just that
    I can give it only so much time while I do physics courses, especially the 9 hr labs every week. Both
    complex analysis and Differential Equations clashed with my other physics courses. One with QFT and other
    with Non-Linear optics.

    I must mention it right here. My algebra is weak. I think I should focus on working on it this sumnmer. From
    linear algebra to Rings and Modules. I have the theory, I need to solve lots of problems. This summer can
    really be invested this way. 

<!-- 
    I need to talk to Chitro though, about how he wants me to get prepared for the
    project. Firstly, I need to gauge if doing such a project and a master's in mathematics even fits. Ahhhh,
    yes, I need to really fix this.
</p>

The aspects in which I found acceptance are:
<ol>
    <li>It is generally okay to work on the intersection of math and physics for a master's degreee in physics.
        People do that from other departments, so it should be fine. </li>
    <li>A math master's degree might involve simply reading extensively too. For example: Soham (B19) read 7
        chapters of a book, on (if I recall correctly) Riemannian Geometry and Gargi read in the first semester about Property T of groups and then read a recent paper on the subject.</li>
    <li>It is okay to apply for a master's in mathemtical physics/math after my master's at NISER. Infact, it's
        alright if I do a 2 year master's too.</li>
</ol>

The aspects which are yet to be figured are:

<ol>
    <li>My interest in pursuing a math project vs the math prerequisites I have. Is it fine? I can rage, is it
        fine? I can work on my basics in the sumemr. Is it okay to aim for a mathematical physics dissertation
        topic?</li>
</ol> -->

<h2>How did it go?</h2>

<p>Let me summarise how the course progressed. We first started out with defining the basic tools that we were
    going to use - <i>vectors, vector fields, integral curves (also maximal), Tangent space.</i> All defined on
    any open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We next worked on <i>n-surfaces</i>, in the framework of level sets. Tangent
    spaces on such surfaces (relation to the gradient of the function(s) in discussion), and then the important
    theorem of Lagrange Multiplier's to extremize a given function with constraint written in the form of
    level set(s). This theorem has got a good intution which Abha and I managed to figure out during a study
    session. A simple application of this goes into proving a symmetric matrix is diagonalizable; just define
    appropriate function (which looks like a mixed polynnomial, and can be written in inner product form) and
    restrict it to a level set. Smoothness of functions on surface, Tangent vector fields surfaces and how there
    exist (maximal) integral curves on them, orientation of surface, the two-oritentation proof for a connected
    surface; the highly intuitive Gauss map (basically capturing all the unit normals <i>onto</i> a sphere; yes
    turns out Gauss map is onto for a compact surface!).

<p> Remember we only defined an <i>n-surface</i> in the framework of a level set. We now extend the concept of
    n-surfaces
    to be either <i>parametric or locally parametric</i> by defining what we mean by a <i>parametrization</i>
    (and also reparametrization).
    We
    basically look for a function that takes us from a low dimenstion euclidean space (locally atleast) to a
    higher one, where our surface recides. Yea, the concept of charts and atlasses sneek in, but we didn't go
    there, although we did use the terminology of chart, as a three tuple ($D\subset\mathbb{R}^2,\phi:D\mapsto
    S,
    S\subset\mathbb{R}^3 $)An n-surface usually means a level set, unless the (local)
    parametrization is specified.</p>

<p>We come back to studying the unit normal, basically the gauss map. We define the <i>orientability</i> of a
    locally parametric n-surface. It is dependent on sign of the determinant of the derivate of the transitions
    functions. Recall that a compact n-surface had two orientations. Guess what, the non-orientability of
    M\"obius strip was proved! We dabbled a
    bit on how a compact, orientable and locally parametrizable n-surface could be seen as an n-surface, by
    questioning the existence of the so called <i>tubular neighborhood</i> (through Inverse function theorem),
    where there is a unique normal line
    passing through each point. I'm not clear on how this leads to an n-surface. This is good direction to
    probe, there are as the instructor briefly alluded about a few conditions to consider and check around.
</p>
<p>Now for the legendary study on the unit normals/gauss map. We define <i>Weingarten map or the Shape
        operator</i> which tell you how much the normal changes along the tangent. It maps one tangent vector to
    another by varying the normal at the initial point, of which the tangenet
    vector belongs to. This turns out to be a very strong concept, that gives out information on the curvature
    of surfaces. It's a self adjoint operator, meaning it has real eigen values. Oh yeah, the map is essentially
    a <i>derivation</i> of normal, so it's a linaer map. We then paused the weingarten map (or the $L_p$ map)
    study and moved on to studying curves.
</p>
<p>$C^k$ curves, reparametrization, regular curves, unit speed ones, their interaction, and then the curvature
    (signed) of the curves; <i>yeah, on how much the curve curves..</i>. Relating this to variation of the angle
    between any vector and the tangent. Then about the space curves, one could define tangent, normal and also
    bi-normal, and have a formula that governs their variation - the <i>Serret-Frenet formula</i>. Then came the
    drumrolls, <i>geodesics.</i> Simple abstraction - the double derivative of the curve at every point has to
    be normal to the tangent space at that point, <i>geodesics got no acceleration along the direction they
        are going to move (tanget space)</i>- translates to speed (norm of the tangent vector) being constant.
    We then proved the existence of geodesics.


<p> <b>That's the end of half the semester :).</b></p>
</p>


<p>
    Back to Weingarten map, probably the most important concept in the entire course. We discuss it in the
    context of locally paramaetric n-surfaces, and define three kind of curvature <i>Principal, Mean and
        Gaussian</i> in terms of the eigenvalues. We tediously computed mean and gaussian curvature for a graph
    of a function and a surface of revolution. A brief mention of existence of minimal (vanishing mean
    curvtature everywhere) later we enter the stage where I found a great fucking book called <i>Gauge fields,
        Knots and Gravity</i> and I simmply couldn't focus on the classes, since I was
    raging at Mathematical Physics and thinking about my future moves - QFT II/GR reading projects, thesis,
    master's after master's, PhD and all that, couldn't resist myself not dindulgin myself in it, too damn
    interesting, and was basically raging yeah.

    But I didn't miss the game though, I noted everything that's going in my mind; just the big picture I mean.
    So it was easy for me to look at Abha's clear notes and understand the stuff. So, moving on, we defined a
    <i>normal section</i>. It's a plane that passes through a point on surface, it's unit tangent, and it's unit
    normal. It's interesection with the surface turned out to be a regular curve! I don't have the big picture
    for normal sections. No idea why we talked about them. ***
