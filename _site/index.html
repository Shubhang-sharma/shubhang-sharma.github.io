        <h2>$\hookrightarrow$ ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p class="about-p">
          I have recently finished my coursework in Integrated Masters in Physical Science from National Institute of
          Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India. I did my master's thesis on AdS/CFT correspondence
          and it's connection to geometry of manifolds. I am interested in topics at the interface of Mathematics and
          Physics. Broadly, I am inclined towards Geometry and Topology on the math side and towards Quantum Field
          Theory and GR on the physics side. Some important directions include symplectic geometry and classical
          mechanics, gauge theory, and more.</p>
          <!-- See my article on <em>The story of Mathematical Physics</em> in the bundle
          page for a sweeping account of interaction between the two sciences along with multiple viewpoints of
          mathematical physics as a field.  -->

      <h2>$\hookrightarrow$ What am I doing now?</h2>
      <p>A general answer to this question has to wait. But zooming in to day-to-day life; academically, I am working
        through Terry Tao's Analysis 1 and TeXing lecture notes on Manifolds. I am also planning to work on a <a href="https://some.3b1b.co/">SoME</a>
        submission this time finally. It will be an article and a website designed based on deRahm's theory and
        Electromagnetism, mostly inspired by John Baez's <em>Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity.</em> My
        understanding of social structure is on the weaker side, so I initiated a process to get scholarly around it. I
        am reading <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari and listening to the great lectures by Dr. Vinay Lal on
        <em>Political
          and Cultural History ofContemporary India</em> these days. The lectures on <em>History of Indian
          Civilization</em> are also quiet rigorous! Currently, I am also looking for place to stay for the next year
        where there is some resonance in academic and personal values.
      </p>
      <p>That was an answer zoomed over the space. Zooming <em>out</em> in time a little, there are some interesting
        things I have been upto. I am enjoying the Indian classical music very much. I have
        been listening to Hindusthani music since two years now, but few months back I started to appreciate
        carnatic music too! I am finally able to experience the beauty of vocals in classical music. Most of my music
        these days come from the app <em>Saarey Music</em> which is truly a work of art making <em>South-Asian</em>
        classical music
        music available at one place. However,they are yet to include a carnatic collection.
      </p>
      <p> I have been taking more interest in psychology of mental health and other aspects of humannes. Books like the
        art of self therapy, I want to die but I want to eat tteokbokki, the
        lost connections, feeling seen, platonic, and the body keeps the score - are truly amazing! The most basic shift
        in perspective I had durng this journey was how the current world is disconnected in
        the most fundamental ways and how marketing industry is absolutely winning over humanity. While on a more
        positive note, I have started to enjoy more simpler life, trying to steer away from the noise. Also, News Papers
        are still relevant and amazing! I got to know about South India's largest <em>paper expo</em> which took place
        at Hyderabad and had a change to visit it a couple of weeks ago. I also got to know about Azim Premji
        university, and this place is beauty.... Their tag, <em>Education for Social Change</em> says it all! One finds
        scholars both into serious research and social change. A place which revolves around a set of values! </p>
      <p>Current guiding principle: <em>To become a scholar... To humanize teaching (and science) and reward deep
          thought... May be to find a scholarly way to contribute to society...</em></p>
      <p>Current <a href="">log of projects</a>.</p>
