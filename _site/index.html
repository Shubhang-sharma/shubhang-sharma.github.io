        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p class="about-div">
        I have recently finished my coursework in Integrated Masters in Physical Science from National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, India. I did my master's thesis on AdS/CFT correspondence and it's  connection to geometry of manifolds. I am interested in topics at the interface of Mathematics and Physics. Broadly, I am inclined towards Geometry and Topology on the math side and towards Quantum Field Theory and GR on the physics side. See my article on <em>The story of Mathematical Physics</em> in the bundle page for a sweeping account of interaction between the two sciences along with multiple viewpoints of mathematical physics as a field. Some  important directions include symplectic geometry and classical mechanics, gauge theory, and more.</p>

      <h2>What am I doing now?</h2>
      <p>A general answer to this question has to wait. But zooming in to day-to-day life, academically I am working through Terry Tao's Analysis 1 and TeXing lecture notes on Manifolds. I am  also planning to work on a SoME submission this time finally. It will be an article and a website designed based on deRahm's theoery and Electromagnetism, mostly inspired by John  Baez's <em>Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity.</em> I have realized my understanding of social structure is on the weaker side, and I have initiated a process to get scholarly around it. I am reading <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari and listening to the great lectures by Dr. Vinay Lal on History and Culture Contemporary India. The lectures on History of Indian Civilization are also quiet rigorous!</p>

 I am a final year master's student in Physics from India. I am fascinated by the mathematical problems which are connected to theoretical Physics - for example, see <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~jbm18/ijg/notes/introtogaugetheory.pdf">Gauge theory</a> or <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~jeffs/symplectic.html">Symplectic Geometry</a>. These directions are epitome of arenas where both math and physics could be understood rigorously, often helping both the fields. I have been studying some of these directions on my own but now I decided to pause that hustle since the path was shabby and am waiting for the break year to carve my own path. For my master's thesis, I am working on AdS/CFT. I like to cycle and run and recently even playing frisbee. I am also a passionate consumer of Film, 3D/Web Art and Music. <i>I make art without being an artist.</i>
     To be more precise, if Life was a bundle I enjoy looking at the fibers of it (in my own way). I am lucky to meet couple of other <i>fiberists of life</i> - <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/trivikramudu/home?authuser=0">Trivikram</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/abhasjournal/Journal-cb09bb7d45aa469885a122dadc45ffa0?pvs=4">Abha</a>, having their own style. 
        </p>     <p>Lately I am curious about web and game development as a medium of art. I am planning to use these media to express the physical and mathematical theories. I have decided to not pursue a PhD immediately after my master's, and instead spend an year exploring things - <i><a href="\fields\2024\08\17\foundation_year.html">a foundation year</a></i>.</p> --></p>
