<p>Having heard through many talks, books and notes that QFT aims to explain particle interactions at the very fundamental level, I waited eagerly to learn how QFT <em>derives</em> the coloumb potential viz. the non-relativistic interaction between two charged particles. If you haven’t yet, it’s truly worth watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNVQfWC_evg&amp;t=39s&amp;pp=ygUZcXVhbnR1bSBmaWVsZHMgZGF2aWQgdG9uZw%3D%3D">this</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo&amp;t=48s&amp;pp=ygUfZGF2aWQgdG9uZyBxdWFudHVtIGZpZWxkIHRoZW9yeQ%3D%3D">this</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of this article is to make the <em>derivation</em> of coloumb potential accessible to the curious minds and to pass the feels of Quantum Field theory by reproducing an infamous result! Hopefully I will also give a talk on this next semester.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The statements won’t be (mathematically) precise.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-notion-of-fields">1. The notion of <em>fields</em></h2>

<p>We ditch the relativistic particle Quantum Mechanics and move to fields. This is a story of its own and hopefully there will be a blog coming soon on the beginnings of QFT. Here we state the tools, feel them and move on.</p>

<h3 id="11-understanding-fields-in-n-levels">1.1 Understanding Fields in n-levels</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fields are functions of space and time - $\phi(x,t)$</li>
  <li>These are the dynamical variables of our new theory. They have infinite degrees of freedom.</li>
  <li>Physically we are interested in the representations of Poincaré group on the space of fields. This will be cleared in the next section.</li>
